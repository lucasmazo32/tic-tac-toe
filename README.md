## Game Instructions

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game on a 3x3 board. The game is played by turns and in each, you will draw an X or an O in an available space on the board (see images below). The winner is the player that can put his/her symbol consecutively in a line (can be a row, column or a diagonal.)

- If you select an incorrect value, you will be asked to put the correct one! A message on the screen will tell you.

- Enjoy! The screen will show you who is the winner!... or if none of you won.

- And last but not least, after the game is over and you want to play again, you just have to type y or Y in the screen and press enter. The player will automatically change positions (The one that started in the first game will be the second in the other one, and so on...).
